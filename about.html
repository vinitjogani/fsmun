Model United Nations - a scholastic and intellectual simulation of the United Nations - is an internationally recognized activity which strives to educate participants in matters of international concern and current events. MUN activities are held around the globe and provide participants with a stage to debate about international issues, and at the same time help them to improve their public speaking, writing and researching skills. The Model UN Circuit in India is one of the biggest and most diverse. The Indian Model UN circuit has seen Model UN transform from a common extra-curricular activity to a conduit for passionate debate and deliberation. The energy and vibrancy of the Indian youth and the fervor with which they take on Model UN parallels the ideals of our conference.

FSMUN is an initiative to promote debate skills, familiarity with world issue and inculcate a global perspective in students from all over the nation. The purpose of the FSMUN is to encourage participants to become international citizens who can rationally and actively participate in discussions, debates and negotiations. FSMUN further promises intellectual exposure and interactive & social experiences along with memorable experiences for all participants. FSMUN hopes to enhance the richness of the Model UN experience in India. Along with our unique conference experience, FSMUN will bring its distinctive special events to India. This combination of engaging activities, lively negotiations and passionate debate will prove to be memorable and should help shape the growing Model UN circuit in India.
