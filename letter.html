    <b>Letter from the Secretary General</b>
    <br><br><br><br>
Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors,
<br><br><br>
On behalf of Fountainhead School, it is my distinct pleasure to welcome you to the second edition of Fountainhead School Model United Nations, FSMUN 2.0.
<br><br>
Following the enlightening and educative experience of FSMUN 1.0, where delegates, organisers and the executive board experienced the critical nature of international relations, sensational rounds of debating and nail-biting crisis breaks, Fountainhead School is proud to present FSMUN 2.0, where we hope to provide participants with an even better and larger platform to share ideas, gain and impart knowledge and learn the subtle art of conflict resolution. 
<br><br>
We hope that FSMUN 2.0 inculcates in its participants a deep understanding of global issues, stellar confidence of public speaking and phenomenal skills of negotiation. A brand of a school that aspires to create a generation of leaders, FSMUN 2.0 is a platform for students to exercise their leadership skills. FSMUN 2.0 is an initiative to give leaders of the future an opportunity to collaborate and interact with their equally driven peers. 
<br><br>
We are really excited to see all of you at the FSMUN  2.0, and we hope that this edition of the event is just as fantastic as the last one!
<br><br>
With regards,
<br>
Aashna Jain
<br>
Secretary General 
<br>
FSMUN 2.0
